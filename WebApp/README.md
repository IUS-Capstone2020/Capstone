The product is an online store built for Kham Mangar’s sister. Their aunts and uncle have been sewing handmade masks and sending them to Kham’s sister to sell. 
This will enable her to have her own online storefront getting her product out in the world with ease. E-commerce is the buying and selling of goods and services over the internet. 
E-commerce can be a substitute for brick-and-mortar stores, though some businesses choose to maintain both. Almost anything can be purchased through e-commerce today. 
This will be an HTML and CSS site hosted by Azure with custom domain.

o Ben Szabo: Computer Science Major working for UPS as a CO-OP and waiting tables at a Japanese restaurant. 
At UPS I mainly write test automation using java and selenium as well as citrus. The tests I’ve written cover anything from UI to API testing for blackbox as well as end to end testing. 
I’m going to be moving to application development within UPS to work on a middleware application that resolves communication issues between other applications.

I am also interested in serving my community through the IT sector in the national guard. Also want to further my education.

o Walker Bolen: I am currently going to school and working full time at American Commercial Barge Line. I work on the ServiceDesk and training to transition to the Microsoft PowerBi team here shortly. 
I have interest in working in databases and working with the general people. If theres something new and cool to learn I hop on it. I wish I had more freetime to broaden my knowledge but at this point work and school is where I learn new skills.
